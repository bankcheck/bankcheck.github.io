Notes for compiling test.cpp:

To compile test.cpp you'll have to copy the following files to the directory where the TEST project is:
	faxcpp.lib
	faxcpp.dll
	tiff.dll
	image.dll
	jpeg.dll
	faxmng.dll
	faxdrv.exe
	faxcpp.h
	faxtype.h
	port32.h

You can open the TEST.MAK file with Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5, or if you use a different compiler, you have to create a new makefile, which includes TEST.CPP, TEST.DEF and FAXCPP.LIB.
Remember to modify the settings in lines 18-22 in TEST.CPP to the proper settings on your system.
