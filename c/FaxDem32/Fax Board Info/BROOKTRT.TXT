Installing Brooktrout fax-board driver

Follow these steps to install the Brooktrout driver on NT:

1.  Go to BFAX_NT\INSTALL directory and run install.exe. This program installs
and sets up the various parameters of the Brooktrout driver.

2.  If you chose to start the driver manually, you have to type at command
prompt:
     net start bfax
After this you also have to run faxinit.exe. The faxinit.exe is in BFAX_NT\USER
directory.
If you chose to start the driver automatically, you have to restart the
system.

3.  If you have TR114 board, you have to include the name of the firmware file
in the configuration file 'BTCALL.CFG'. This file can be found in the BFAX_NT
directory. If your TR114 board works with FX16 CPU, include the name of the
firmware (the default is tr114-16.pex) in the line starting with the keyword
'firm16'.  If you have a TR114 board which works with FX164 CPU, include the
name of the firmware (the default is tr114-164.pex) in the line starting with
the keyword 'firmware' or 'firm164'. The firmware file must be in the current
directory ( where you running the executable ) or the correct path must be
included with its name.

4. If you have a TruFax 200 or TruFax 100 board, and their installation
causes any conflicts with other hardware on your system, you may need to
create a config.txt configuration file and pass it with full path as
parameter to the faxinit.exe. This can be done at installation time,
when the install program asks the user to enter optional parameters for
faxinit.exe.
The config.txt should have the following format:

addrs 140 2

This file set up for a single TruFax 200 board with the default configuration.
The parameters indicate a two channel TruFax board installed at base address
140 and is using interrupt 5.

If you installed two TruFax 200 boards in your system (one at address 140 and
the other at address 148), you must change the contents of the configuration
file:

addrs 140 2
addrs 148 2


5.  BTCALL.CFG also contains the name of the country-specific configuration
file. This file is shipped with the Brooktrout boards and usually its name is
BT_CPARM.CFG. Have a look at the line in BTCALL.CFG which starts with the
keyword 'bt_cparm' and if the entry afterwards differs from the name of your
country-specific configuration file, enter the right name. You have to enter
the filename with full path unless you copy the file in the directory where
BTCALL.CFG is.

6. BTCALL.CFG also contains references to a font file and several other
config files ( digital.cfg, isdn.cfg ). These files have to be located in the
current directory or the full path must be specified.

When you open a brooktrout fax channel with demo32.exe, you have to give the
name of this BTCALL.CFG file. If you don't include the path, the file should
be in the same subdirectory as demo32.exe .  If you want to recompile the demo
application, first you have to choose the proper built target. The code to support
Brooktrout fax board will be included in the demo,  you will choose either 'Debug
for Brooktrout' or "Release for Brooktrout'.


Follow these steps to install the Brooktrout driver on Windows 95:

1.  Go to BFAX_95\INSTALL directory and run install.exe. This program installs
and sets up the various parameters of the Brooktrout driver.

2.  If you chose to start the driver manually, you have to type at command
prompt:
     bfaxload.exe
After this you also have to run faxinit.exe. The faxinit.exe is in BFAX_95\USER
directory.
If you chose to start the driver automatically, you have to restart the
system.

in the configuration file 'BTCALL.CFG'. This file can be found in the BFAX_95
directory. If your TR114 board works with FX16 CPU, include the name of the

the keyword 'firmware' or 'firm164'. The firmware file must be in the current
