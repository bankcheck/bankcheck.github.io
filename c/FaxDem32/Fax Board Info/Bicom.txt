Using Fax C++ with Bicom Sonic C4 fax boards

To develop software for Bicom boards, you must also have the driver of
the board installed and properly configured on your system.

Fax C++ will try to locate the Bicom dlls using the registry. If the driver
of the Bicom board is correctly installed, the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFWARE\BICOM path in the registry will contain a key
named SupportPath. This key stores the path of the Bicom dlls.
If this key does not exist or the path is invalid or does not contains the Bicom dlls
Fax C++ will not work with the Bicom board.
It's also necessary to run the BCMLOAD.EXE program (shipped with the Bicom board)
before using the Bicom board with Fax C++.

Since the Bicom API already has a channel naming convention (BCM_MBxCHy),
Fax C++ uses the same channel names when working with Bicom boards.
The general form is `BCM_MBxCHy' where `x' is the number of the board and
`y' is the number of the channel on the board specified by `x'.
This is the name that must be passed to ConnectChannel()
to open a channel. For example to open the second channel of the first board
     pFaxport = ConnectChannel( "BCM_MB1CH2", NULL, BRD_BICOM );
The board and channel numbers start with 1.
As you can see the second parameter is NULL, meaning that it is not necessary to
specify any INI or configuration files when working with Bicom boards.
