Using Fax C++ with Dialogic fax boards

To develop software for Dialogic boards, you must also have the driver of
the board installed and properly configured on your system.
The driver can be downloaded for Windows 95 and NT from
ftp://support.dialogic.com/releases .

Since the Dialogic API already has a channel naming convention (dxxxB1C1),
Fax C++ uses the same channel names when working with Dialogic boards.
The general form is `dxxxBXCY' where `X' is the number of the board and
`Y' is the number of the channel on the board specified by `X'.
This is the name that must be passed to ConnectChannel()
to open a channel. For example to open the second channel of the first board
     pFaxport = ConnectChannel( "dxxxB1C2", NULL, BRD_DIALOGIC );
The board and channel numbers start with 1.
As you can see the second parameter is NULL, meaning that it is not necessary to
specify any INI or configuration files when working with Dialogic boards.
