Using Fax C++ with GammaLink fax boards

The 32 bit version of Fax C++ works with GammaLink fax boards under Windows NT.
To develop software for GammaLink boards, you must also have the driver of
the board installed and properly configured on your system.

The name of the GammaLink NT device driver: GNCFD.
The names of the two Services: Dialogic and GammaFax.
Both the device driver and the two services must be started.

The GFAX environment variable, which is created by the GammaLink configuration
utility, must point to the subdirectory which contains the configuration file.
When you try to use a channel, you have to specify the name of the configuration
file as the second parameter of the function "ConnectChannel()".
If you don't specify the path, the software will look for it in the
subdirectory specified by GFAX environment variable.

The transmission parameters like, ECM, max or min transmission, baud rate,
of the fax board can only be set through the GammaLink configuration file
( default name: GFAX.$DC ). See Table 4.2 Summary of Configuration Commands in
Gammalink Reference Manual for Windows NT Version 2.0.
Because of this, Every Fax C++ function which sets or returns transmission
parameters, will not work with GammaLink boards. For details, see the Fax
C++ programmer's reference.

If you are using FaxCpp with GammaLink driver version 3.0 you don't have to
specify any configuration files when opening the channels.
