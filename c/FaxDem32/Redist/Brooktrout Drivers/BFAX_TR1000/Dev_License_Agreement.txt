2.	License

2.1	Demonstration or Evaluation.  If the Software is provided to Developer as a demonstration or evaluation unit, (a) the licenses granted in Section 2.2 shall not apply and (b) Cantata grants the Developer, and the Developer accepts, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license (without the right to grant sublicenses) to use the Software for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery of the Software to Developer for the sole purpose of evaluating the suitability of such Software.  Under no circumstances shall the Software be used for any commercial purposes, and Developer is not being granted any rights to distribute the Software under this Agreement without the express written permission of Cantata. 

2.2	License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Cantata grants Developer a license to use and distribute the Software subject to and in accordance with the following provisions. 

	(a)	If the Software is distributed to Developer for use with Cantata Hardware, Cantata grants Developer a royalty-free, non-transferable license (without the right to grant sublicenses, except as set forth in Section 2.9) to (i) use the Software solely for the purposes of developing Integrated Products; (ii) make copies of the Software for distribution to End Users, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of an Integrated Product, solely for use by such End Users for their internal business purposes in connection with Cantata Hardware; and (iii) distribute the Software to End Users, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of an Integrated Product, solely for use by such End Users for their internal business purposes in connection with Cantata Hardware.  The Software is used in connection with Cantata Hardware if it is operated only on the central processing unit of a computer served by one or more items of Cantata Hardware and, where appropriate in connection with such use, it is downloaded into memory located on Cantata Hardware.

	(b)	If the Software is distributed to Developer as host-based media processing software, Cantata grants Developer a royalty-bearing, non-transferable license (without the right to grant sublicenses, except as set forth in Section 2.9) to (i) use the Software solely for the purpose of developing Integrated Products;  (ii) make copies of the Software for distribution to End Users, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of an Integrated Product for the End Users' internal business purposes; and (iii) distribute copies of the Software to End Users, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of an Integrated Product for the End Users' internal business purposes, subject to the purchase by the End User of a License Key.  Developer shall not distribute or otherwise transfer any Developer License Key for any purpose without Cantata's prior written consent.

2.3	Copies.  Developer shall not remove or alter any copyright or other proprietary notices that appear on the Software and shall include all such notices on all copies of the Software (including without limitation all copies of the Software that are incorporated into Integrated Products). 

2.4	No Reverse Engineering.  Developer shall have no rights to any source code for the Software. Developer agrees that it shall not cause or permit the disassembly, decompilation or reverse engineering of the Software or otherwise attempt to gain access to the source code to the Software.  If applicable law requires access to source code for some purpose, such as inter-operability with other software, and Developer desires access for that required purpose, Developer shall notify Cantata, and Cantata shall have the option, in its discretion, to (i) perform the work to derive any required information at Cantata's usual consulting rate, or (ii) allow Developer access to source code solely for the legally required purpose. 

2.5	Additional Restrictions.  Developer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Software to a third party without the prior written approval of Cantata. 

2.6	Reservation of Rights.  Cantata and its licensors reserve all rights not otherwise expressly granted in this Section 2.  Any use, modification, reproduction or distribution of the Software not expressly permitted under this Agreement is hereby expressly prohibited. 

2.7	License Keys.  The use of the Software may require a License Key.  Developer shall not (a) use any access code or activation key other than the Developer License Key (if any) provided by Cantata or (b) develop or alter any access code for the Software or otherwise circumvent or attempt to circumvent the License Key or Developer License Key. 

2.8	End User Agreements.  The Software shall be distributed to each End User under an End User Agreement entered into by such End User which may be a shrink-wrap, break-the-seal or click-wrap or executed written agreement which provides for the same level of protection of Cantata's title, rights and defenses as this Agreement, and pursuant to which the End User agrees (a) to use the Software solely for its own internal business purposes, and not for further distribution or licensing; (b) not to copy the Software in whole or in part, except as permitted under applicable law, and then only with the inclusion of all copyright, proprietary and other notices; (c) not to permit any parent, subsidiaries, affiliated entities or third parties to use the Software; and (d) not rent, lease, loan or transfer the Software.  Where the Software or Integrated Product is distributed to an End User pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the End User shall also agree to use the Software solely in connection with Cantata Hardware.  Developer may include in such End User Agreement, the terms of the limited warranty attached as Exhibit B hereto.

2.9	Sublicenses.  Developer shall have the right to sublicense its rights under Sections 2.2(a)(iii) and 2.2(b)(iii) solely to allow Sublicensees to distribute the Software to End Users, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of Developer's Integrated Product, but in no event shall any Sublicensee have the right to (a) use the Software to develop its own integrated products or (b) make copies of the Software.  Each Sublicensee shall execute a Sublicense Agreement that contains substantially similar terms and conditions as are contained in this Agreement and provides for the same level of protection of Cantata's title, rights and defenses as this Agreement. 

2.10	Protection of Rights.  Developer will use the same efforts that it would use to protect its own rights, including its intellectual property rights, but not less than commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Sublicensees and End Users comply with the terms of their respective agreements, and will notify Cantata of any known violation.  Upon Cantata's request, Developer will supply Cantata with a copy of any sublicense agreement by and between Developer and any Sublicensees or End Users.

3.	Ownership

3.1	Cantata or its licensors own and shall retain all proprietary rights, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and any modifications thereto made by any entity. 

3.2	Except as set forth in a separate agreement between Cantata and Developer, Developer shall have no right to receive any corrections, enhancements, upgrades or other modifications to the Software ("Changes").  Unless otherwise agreed to in such separate agreement, any Changes to the Software provided by Cantata to Developer in accordance with the separate agreement shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.  If Developer does receive Changes from Cantata, it shall incorporate those Changes into Software that it distributes to End Users under Section 2.2 for initial installation by End Users.  Developer acknowledges that the license granted under this Agreement does not provide Developer with title to or ownership of the Software, but only a right of limited use under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Sections 2.3-2.8, 2.10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.
